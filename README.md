# Missionaries-and-Canninals-game
 
Rules

• The game starts with three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river, along with a boat that can carry a maximum of two people.
• The player must select combinations of characters (either one, two missionaries, or one, two cannibals) to transport across the river using the boat.
• If at any point there are more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river, the cannibals will eat the missionaries, resulting in a game over.
• The player wins the game when all three missionaries and three cannibals successfully reach the other side of the river.
